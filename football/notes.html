	 All player names are the most typical versions used in England. 
	 <br>

	 In cases where there is a player name which includes such a letter, the closest English alphabetic equivalent is used.
	 <br>
	 - All player names are case sensitive and include spaces where applicable. 
	 <br>
	 - Also surname prefixes such as "van" for example, where required are case sensitive.  
	 <br>
	 - Entering a different starting letter to what is specified will terminate game.
		<br>
