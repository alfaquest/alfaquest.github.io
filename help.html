	ΑLΦΑQUΕSΤ TUTORIAL AND GAME NOTES.
	
	ΑLΦΑQUΕSΤ GAME OBJECTIVE:  
	Navigate through a sequence of words from a stated category.  
	Each word must begin with a unique starting letter. 

	The starting letter of each word (after the first, which for now will be 'A'),  
	is decided by its position within, and availability from the previously  
	selected word in the game. 

	EXAMPLE: 
	If word 1 is Albania, word 2 must begin with letter 'L' (2nd letter in Albania). 
	However if selected word 2 is Latvia, word 3 cannot begin with 
	previously used letter 'A' (2nd letter in Latvia). 
	So 'A' is skipped and we move on to the letter 'T', (3rd letter in Latvia), 
	and so it continues.  

	GAME PROGRESSION:  
	As the game progresses, it is possible for the next starting letter to  
	be contained in position 4, 5, 10 or even position 20 of the previously  
	selected word. 

	The game will continue until all starting letters have been navigated  
	successfully in sequence, a glorious victory! Or if a game terminating  
	cul de sac is reached, a not dishonourable failure. 

	A cul de sac is a scenario in which the current chosen word consists  
	of only previously used letters, leaving the player with nowhere to go,  
	resulting in an unsuccessful game. 

	Good luck and no cheating, not that it will help you much!
